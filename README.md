# Hands on! üñê Mapbox Interactive Mapping Demo

This repository containst the project files for the Interactive Mapping Workshop. Create a fork and let us know what you create! 

Here's how to get started:

## Step #1: Get API Access

You need a Mapbox access token to use any of Mapbox's tools, APIs, or SDKs. Mapbox uses access tokens to associate your account with your requests to Mapbox API resources. 

### Create a Mapbox Account

- You will need to have a Mapbox account to create a token. Head on over to [mapbox.com](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/) to sign up (it's free).

### Copy your Access Token

Once you're logged in, you can find your access tokens. Edit `static/access_token.js` and add your mapbox default public access token. 

## Step #2: Install

Open a terminal window in the root folder of the repo. Run the following commands:
`$ yarn install`
`$ yarn start`

The local IP will be displayed in the console.
